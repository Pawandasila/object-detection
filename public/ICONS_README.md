# Object Detection App Icons

These files should contain the app icons:

## Required Icon Files:
- `/public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `/public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Icon Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Design**: Simple camera or detection-themed icon
- **Colors**: Blue theme (#3b82f6) to match the app

## Temporary Solution:
For now, you can:
1. Use any square PNG files renamed to `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
2. Place them in the `/public` folder
3. The app will work without icons, but PWA installation will be limited

## Icon Ideas:
- Camera with AI elements
- Eye with detection rays
- Simple geometric shape with app colors
- Camera lens with crosshairs

The build will complete without these files, but having them improves the PWA experience.
