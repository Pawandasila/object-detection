# Enhanced Object Detection App

This is an advanced object detection application with improved accuracy, performance, and functionality.

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. **Enhanced AI Model Support**
- **Multiple Model Types**: Choose between Lite, MobileNet V1, and MobileNet V2 for different accuracy/speed trade-offs
- **Dynamic Model Loading**: Switch between models without restarting the app
- **Optimized Performance**: Better memory management and model disposal

### 2. **Advanced Detection Controls**
- **Adjustable Confidence Threshold**: Fine-tune detection sensitivity (0.1 - 0.95)
- **Real-time FPS Control**: Monitor and adjust detection frame rate
- **Start/Stop Detection**: Control when detection is active
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS and detection statistics

### 3. **Enhanced Visualization**
- **Color-coded Bounding Boxes**: Different colors for different object types
- **Confidence Scores**: Shows detection confidence percentage for each object
- **Confidence Bars**: Visual representation of detection confidence
- **Object Tracking**: Numbered objects for easier tracking
- **Animated Alerts**: Pulsing borders and corner indicators for important detections
- **Statistics Overlay**: Real-time summary of detected objects

### 4. **Advanced Audio System**
- **Multiple Alert Types**: Different sounds for different objects (person, car, etc.)
- **Speech Synthesis**: Voice announcements for detections
- **Fallback Audio**: Web Audio API beeps when sound files aren't available
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable audio levels
- **Throttled Alerts**: Prevents audio spam

### 5. **Smart Configuration**
- **Device Optimization**: Automatically adjusts settings based on device capabilities
- **Performance Presets**: Low, Medium, High performance modes
- **Class Filtering**: Focus on specific object types
- **Alert Configuration**: Customize which objects trigger alerts

## ðŸŽ¯ Model Comparison

| Model Type | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Lite** | Fastest | Good | Real-time applications, older devices |
| **MobileNet V1** | Medium | Better | Balanced performance |
| **MobileNet V2** | Slower | Best | High accuracy requirements |

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Basic Controls
1. **Model Selection**: Choose your preferred model type
2. **Confidence Adjustment**: Set minimum confidence threshold
3. **Detection Toggle**: Start/stop object detection
4. **Real-time Stats**: Monitor performance and detections

### Audio Setup
To add custom alert sounds:
1. Add your audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG) to the `/public` folder
2. The app will automatically fall back to programmatic beeps if audio files are missing

### Performance Optimization
- **For older devices**: Use Lite model with higher confidence threshold
- **For accuracy**: Use MobileNet V2 with lower confidence threshold  
- **For real-time**: Use Lite model with medium confidence

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements

### Object Detection Display
- **Color-coded boxes**: Each object type has a unique color
- **Confidence indicators**: Progress bars show detection confidence
- **Object numbering**: Each detected object gets a unique ID
- **Statistics panel**: Live count of detected objects by type

### Person Detection Alerts
- **Pulsing red borders**: Animated warning indicators
- **Corner markers**: Professional-style target indicators
- **Alert text**: Clear "PERSON DETECTED" messages
- **Audio alerts**: Sound notifications for person detection

## ðŸ›  Technical Improvements

### Performance
